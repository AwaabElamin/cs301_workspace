1. What are alternatives to default parameters?
 it will be undefined. even if we call the function without it "FunctionName()".
 for example:
    function f(num){return num;}
    console.log(f());
we call function f without send any value to its paramerter. in this case the parameter
num didn't assigned or intialize. for that, the output will be undefined

2. What are things you should consider while naming a function?
    - the name must start with a character (not a number and not a symbol);
    - must not contains spaces.
    - the name must be a unige in the all scope that contains the function. 
        so, can not be cofusing by another one.
    - don't allow to use any keyword
    -do not allow to use sample $
    - should follow camelCase
