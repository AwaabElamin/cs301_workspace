1\ What happens when you forget a break while using switch statement? 
    after it run all the statements of that block, it continue to checking the next
    case and it will execute all the statements of that case if the expression true.

2\ What will be the output of running following code? 
    var foo = 0; 
    switch (foo) { 
      case -1: 
        console.log('negative 1'); 
    break; 
    case 0:  
        console.log(0); 
    case 1:  
        console.log(1); 
    break;  
    case 2: 
        console.log(2); 
    break; 
    default: 
        console.log('default'); 
    } 
    output:
    0
    1
3. Will output change if value of foo is a ‘0’ (0 in quotes) instead? 
    Yes it will change.
    zero in quotes will change the data type of variable foo from number to string.
    This will let the comparison in cases (numbers vs string) always false. 
    which means no one of the above cases will execute. For that, the only one that will execute
    is default block. So, the output will be:
    default
